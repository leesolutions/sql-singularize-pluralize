Rails inflections based singularize and pluralize methods for TSQL.

How to use:
- select master.dbo.Pluralize('car')
  outputs: 'cars'

Config:
- download SqlRegEx.dll into c:\
- run install.sql on SQL Server 2005 instance
- test: select master.dbo.Pluralize('car')
- add regular expressions for singular, plural, irregular and uncountable into tsql_singularize_pluralize table.

To Do's:
- Update CRL to support round bracketed backreference in replace method
  Steve's CRL for reg exp methods fails on reg replace for round bracketed backreference
